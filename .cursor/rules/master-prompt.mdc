# Overview
Rules:
- Do NOT flatten or merge components
- Preserve the Figma layer hierarchy
- Each Frame or Group = one React component
- Nested layers = child components
- Use composition, not one large component

Styling:
- Match Figma values exactly (colors, spacing, typography)
- Extract repeated colors into CSS variables
- Use flexbox or grid where possible

Code:
- Use semantic HTML
- Components must be reusable
- Keep components small and readable
- Do not over-optimize or guess missing design

Storybook Rule:

- This project uses Storybook to develop and verify UI components.
- Every UI component must have a corresponding Storybook story.
- Components must be built and validated in isolation, not inside pages.
- Do not rely on application pages to test or style components.
- Stories should represent the component’s default and key states only.
